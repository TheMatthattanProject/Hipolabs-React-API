# Hipolabs-React-API
Example Redux React app for showcasing API calls and formatting.

## Install
Assumptions: node is installed for the user.
Once repository is cloned, run `npm install` in `./base-app`.

## Run
From the `./base-app` directory, run `npm run start`.

## Features 
 - Table is searchable, paginated and sortable (With the ability to change the number of results on the page).
 - The search works on any and all columns, being case agnostic.
 - Add and delete are designed to work with filtered results, as to show more visible changes.
 - Tailwind CSS and Redux have been setup for easier future development.

## Possible improvements
 - Apply search filter after loading.
 - Keep consistent arrangement of components, even with layout shifts (Go to the last results page).
